THIS SPRINT
# 1 Access to the tables for monster creation.


# 2 Determine based on integer values what expected CR value a given statistic is closest to.
    CR 10 AC == 24
    Given AC == 20
    Determined CR for AC == 7.0
    
    Given AC == 26
    Determined CR for AC == 11.5

    previous value + next value + given value / 3 == expected value

    The above works for:
        HP          # Integer
        AC          # Integer
        Good save   # Integer
        Poor save   # Integer
        Primary DC

3 Determine CR value for the following:
        # Attack (High or low based on flag, otherwise same as #2)

        Damage Average + high and low to see maximum and minimum values for that CR, requires #5

        Secondary DC (THIS IS THE MINIMUM VALUE) # Needs minimum DC value tagged as used for offense

# 4 Need to determine Damage:
    Need high value and low value to see the outer limits for what is considered that CR value for dmg.
    Average value to have a static value to aim for. This can actually be a boolean, so long as final value is rounded to an integer.

5 overlap handling for damage values.
    Sometimes the high value for CR is higher than the low value for the CR++.
    Damage CR 2
        Low == 7
        High == 10
        Average == 17/2 == 8.5
    Damage CR 3
        Low == 9
        High == 13
        Average == 22/2 == 11
    
    get average values
    find average value between the average values
    average of averages == 19.5/2 == 9.75

    use this value for determining high and low instead.
    If the value goes above or below this value, also check if it is still within the original high and low, which would still be considered within reason of this CR.

# 6 Check if AC values is within 5 of target CR AC.

7 Attributes that we Need
    Target CR (The CR that we are aiming for and originating our scale from)
    Suggested CR (The CR that the app determines that the creature probably has based on values for defense and offense)
    Offensive CR (The calculated offensive CR of creature)
    Defensive CR (The calculated defensive CR of creature)

    HP
    AC
    Saves

    Damage
    Attack
    DC

    Toggle for Attack based or DC based offense

8 Determine Offensive CR

9 Determine Defensive CR

10 Determine suggested CR
    This should be done based off of determined offensive and defensive CR.

    I personally believe if a CR is very close by decimals to a different CR than the whole number, then it should be rounded in that direction
    but within .26 and .74 or something it might be better to round down for high offense / low defense and round up for vice versa

BONUS
    Primary attack Ranged Toggle (Flying + ranged combo at lower levels is dangerous af and might be cause for +1CR bump)
    Flying Toggle
    Incorporeal Toggle (Incorporeal at low level is dangerous af and might be grounds for doubling hp values for calc)
    Swarm toggle (Swarms at low level is dangerous af and might be grounds for doubling hp values for calc)

FUTURE SPRINTS
    Monster tiers
    Monster stats below CR 1/2
